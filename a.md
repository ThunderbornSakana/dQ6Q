We agree that bar plots are ideal for discrete hyperparameters. However, the main purpose of Figure 7 is to demonstrate that DelayAdapter effectively maintains the performance hierarchy of the four base models, as evaluated with Oracle across all datasets. Importantly, **we aim to visualize two consistent trends in each subplot**. To achieve this, integrating both bar and line plots in a single figure is beneficial. **Please refer to the updated Figure 7 in the file "base_model.pdf" in this repository**. Thank you.
